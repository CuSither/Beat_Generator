This program is designed to send MIDI to Ableton via macOS's IAC driver, and without the Ableton project and the samples
and plugins that are used in it, the code here doesn't do much good. The RhythmGenerator and ChordGenerator classes 
could be rewritten to more easily set MIDI values for percussion triggers and MIDI channels for different instruments,
but as it stands right now the values are hard coded for a specific Ableton session. 

Because the code can't be run, the included keynote is worth looking over, and the demo mp3's do a good job of showing
what the program can do.
